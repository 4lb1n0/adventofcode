# Advent of Code
Personal repository of Advent of Code solutions. Coded in Python. Still a beginner so code will be untidy and not time optimised.


# About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after the first is solved). 
If you like the project and want to support it, you can [donate here](https://adventofcode.com/support).
